sensor/⁠touch (*)
This element creates a touch sensor. The active sensor zone is defined by a site. If a contact point falls within the site’s volume, and involves a geom attached to the same body as the site, the corresponding contact force is included in the sensor reading. If a contact point falls outside the sensor zone, but the normal ray intersects the sensor zone, it is also included. This re-projection feature is needed because, without it, the contact point may leave the sensor zone from the back (due to soft contacts) and cause an erroneous force reading. 
The output of this sensor is non-negative scalar. It is computed by adding up the (scalar) normal forces from all included contacts.
